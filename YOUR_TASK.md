# 2.6 - Connecting HTML to JavaScript

##### ICS3 - Mr. Brash 🐿️

# 📝 Your Task:

### Part 1 - Clickable Picture
We can change the `src` of a picture using JavaScript:
```JS
document.getElementById("my_pic").src = "./images/new_picture.png";
```

- Find two pictures online and add them to your `./images` folder.
- Place one of the images on the page and give it the `id` "swap_pic".
- Create a JS function `swap()` that will change the `src` of the image to the second picture.
- Add a 'click' event listener to the image so that when it is clicked, it switches to the second image.
