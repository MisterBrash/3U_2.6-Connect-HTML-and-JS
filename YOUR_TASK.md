### Part 5: More Practice!

Now that you have these skills, there are so many great opportunities for your coding future!

Try writing the following functions:

- `percent(score, total)` - people like to know what they got on a test. Print a person's score, rounded to the nearest _whole percent_, to the console. Don't forget the `%` sign! Your function should _return_ the result as the pure decimal answer. For example `percent(8, 13)` prints `62%` but _returns_ 0.6153846153846154.  

- `pythagorean_theorem(a, b)` - exactly what you think. Return the length of the hypotenuse (c) given the two legs of a right triangle, `a`, and `b`. For example: `pythagorean_theorem(3, 4)` should return 5.  

- `round(value, decimals)` - **This one requires a math brain - do _not_ search for a solution, do it yourself!**  
  Rounding to the nearest whole number with `Math.round()` is useful, but what if we want the tenths, hundredths, or thousandths of a value? Create the function `round(value, decimals)` that _returns_ the `value` rounded to the requested number of `decimals`. For example: `round(Math.PI, 4)` would return 3.1416 but `round(0.65, 0)` returns 1.
